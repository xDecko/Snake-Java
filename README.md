# JavaSnake: Classic Snake Game Implementation 

JavaSnake is a classic implementation of the popular Snake game, built entirely in Java. This project showcases object-oriented programming principles and provides an engaging gaming experience.

The game faithfully recreates the nostalgic gameplay of the original Snake game, where players control a snake to navigate a grid and eat food to grow longer. However, this implementation goes beyond just recreating the classic game by leveraging the power of Java.
